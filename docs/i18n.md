# i18n Support

The boilerplate is prepared to support internationalization (i18n) and translations for your WordPress plugin.

## Translate your plugin
1. Run `npm run i18n:extract` to generate the `.pot` file in the `languages/` directory and update existing `.po` files.
2. Translate the strings in the `.po` files existing or create a new file for each language you want to support.
3. (Optional) Run `npm run i18n:compile` to compile the `.po` files into `.mo`, `.json` and `.php` files for use by WordPress. The `deploy` action does this automatically.

This process allows you translating blocks and generate the fast [php format](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/i18n-improvements-6-5-performant-translations/) for maximum performance.

### Using AI
The boilerplate does provide a command to instruct your coding agent to do the work for you.

`/upsert-translations [lang1 lang2 ...]`

The command is set up for opencode but can be manually pasted in every other agent system.

## Actually translating strings
The `.po` files have to be created and the strings have to actually be translated. You can use tools like [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or [Loco Translate](https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin) to manage translations.
Another thing that works well is using is to ask your coding agent to "upsert the translations".

## Thing to keep in mind
- The textdomain has to be exactly the one defined in `demo-plugin.php`. Otherwise, extraction will not find the strings.
- The provided scripts only work if `wp-cli` is available and a fully working WordPress installation is present.
- i18n Strings in Enums are not supported due to upstream library limitation in `gettext`
- To extract twig strings you need to install https://github.com/timber/wp-i18n-twig
