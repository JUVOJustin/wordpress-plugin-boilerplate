Use the `docs/` folder for all plugin documentation. Organize files and subfolders in any structure that fits the project.

## Structure Is Flexible

Group documentation by feature, workflow, or integration. Create subfolders when it helps discovery, and keep filenames descriptive so they can be linked directly from `README.md` or other docs. Author docs as MDX so components can be used when helpful.

## Front Matter Metadata

Front matter is optional, and documentation can be created freely. Using it is a best practice; when you include it, add a `title`, a `short_title`, and a `description` so automated tooling can parse the docs.

```yaml
---
title: Asset Bundling
short_title: Bundling
description: How scripts and styles are built and enqueued.
---
```

## Headings and Intro

Do not repeat the front matter `title` as an H1 in the body. Start with a short paragraph or an H2 such as `## Overview`.

```md
---
title: Asset Bundling
short_title: Bundling
description: How scripts and styles are built and enqueued.
---

Short intro paragraph.

## Overview
...
```

## Code Blocks

Use Expressive Code attributes on fenced code blocks. These attributes are ignored when unsupported, so it is best practice to include them consistently.

- Always specify a language for syntax highlighting (e.g. `bash`, `php`, `js`).
- Add a `title="..."` when the snippet belongs to a file or a terminal session.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run build
```

```php title="src/Demo_Plugin.php"
private function enqueue_entrypoint( string $entry, array $localize_data = array() ): void
```

## Folder Structures

When documenting folder layouts, use the Starlight FileTree component so directories and files render consistently.

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src
  - ...
</FileTree>
```
