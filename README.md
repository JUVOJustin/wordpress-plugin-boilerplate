This boilerplate is a fork of [WordPress Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) with additional features and improvements. It provides a modern, organized, and object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress plugins.

## Features of this boilerplate
- Namespaces support using composer
- Automatic Namespace prefixing with [Strauss](https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss)
- Easy Shortcode, CLI Command Registration through the loader
- PHPStan with ready-made Github actions
- PHPCS with ready-made Github actions
- [@wordpress/scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) for simple bundling and build of assets
- ESLint built in
- Ready-made Github actions for building and bundling
- Ready-made [opencode](https://opencode.ai) commands for common tasks (compatible with any LLM)

# Setup

## Step 1: Create Your Project
Run the following command to create your project in the current folder. This will download the boilerplate and automatically run the script for initial configuration:

```bash
composer create-project juvo/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate
```

The boilerplate will be set up in the current directory, and the setup script will run automatically.

## Step 2: Configure Your Plugin (Automatic Prompt)
Upon project creation, you'll be guided through a series of prompts to configure your plugin:

- **Plugin Name**: Enter the name of your plugin.
- **Namespace (optional)**: Suggests a default namespace based on your plugin name but allows customization.
- **Plugin Slug (optional)**: Choose a slug for your plugin; a default based on your plugin name is suggested.

Your inputs will automatically tailor the boilerplate to match your plugin's identity.

## Step 3: Finalization (Optional)
After configuration, the setup will finalize by updating files, renaming relevant items, and performing cleanup actions, including:
- Replacing placeholders with your specified details.
- Renaming files to match your plugin's namespace and slug.
- Running `composer update` and `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Cleaning up by removing the `setup.php` file and the setup cli command.

At this point, the plugin is set up and good to go. Now it's your time to adjust plugin and readme headers according to your needs.

# Development Guide

## Project Structure

### Source Code Organization

All plugin logic should go into the `src` folder. This separation helps maintain a clean structure and follows modern PHP development practices. Example: 

```
src/
├── API/           # Rest API-specific functionality
├── CLI/           # CLI commands
└── Integrations/  # Core plugin functions and utilities
    └── BricksBuilder/ # Bricks Builder integration
    └── Elementor/ # Elementor integration
    └── ACF/ # ACF integration
    └── WC/ # WooCommerce integration
```

Avoid placing logic directly in the plugin's root files. The main plugin file should primarily be used for bootstrapping your plugin.

## Loader and Hooks Registration

### Using the Loader Correctly

The plugin uses a loader pattern to centralize the registration of hooks, filters, and shortcodes. Instead of registering hooks in class constructors, always use the loader in the root class:

```php
// In your Plugin.php main class
public function __construct() {
    $this->loader = new Loader();
    $this->define_admin_hooks();
    $this->define_public_hooks();
}

private function define_admin_hooks() {
    $admin = new Admin\Admin($this->get_plugin_name(), $this->get_version());
    $this->loader->add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', $admin, 'enqueue_styles');
    $this->loader->add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', $admin, 'enqueue_scripts');
}

private function define_shortcodes() {
    $example_shortcode = new Shortcodes\ExampleShortcode();
    $this->loader->add_shortcode('example', $example_shortcode, 'render');
}
```

This approach provides several benefits:
1. Centralized hook management
2. Easier debugging
3. Better testability
4. Cleaner class implementations

## Frontend Assets Management

### Resources Organization

All frontend-facing assets (scripts, styles, images, etc.) should be placed in the `resources` directory, organized by context:

```
resources/
├── admin/            # Admin-specific assets
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
├── frontend/         # Frontend-specific assets
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
├── acf-json/         # ACF field group JSON files
└── webpack.config.js     # webpack/wp-scripts configuration
```

### Asset Compilation

The boilerplate uses [@wordpress/scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) for asset compilation and bundling.

To compile assets:
```
npm run start        # Watch for changes during development and compile assets
npm run build         # For production. Compiles assets and minifies them
```

To add a new entry point for scripts or styles, modify the `webpack.config.js` file.

## Quality Assurance and Workflows

### Default Checks and Quality Pipelines

The boilerplate comes with the following quality assurance tools configured:

1. **PHP CodeSniffer (PHPCS)**: Enforces WordPress coding standards
2. **PHPStan**: Provides static analysis to catch potential bugs
3. **ESLint**: Ensures JavaScript code quality
4. **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and building processes

These checks run automatically in GitHub pipelines when you push code to your repository.

### GitHub Workflows

The boilerplate includes the following GitHub Actions workflows:

- **Quality Checks**: Runs PHPCS and PHPStan to ensure code quality
- **Asset Building**: Compiles and bundles frontend assets
- **Release Management**: Helps with versioning and releases

## PHP Version Management

Changing the PHP version for your plugin requires updates in multiple places to ensure consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.

### Composer Configuration

The plugin's PHP version requirements must be updated in `composer.json` in two places:

1. The `require` section specifies the minimum PHP version:

```json
"require": {
    "php": ">=8.0"
}
```

2. The `config.platform` section which controls what PHP version Composer uses for compatibility checks:

```json
"config": {
    "platform": {
        "php": "8.0"
    }
}
```

After updating these values, run `composer update` to update your dependencies based on the new PHP version constraints.

### GitHub Pipeline Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflows are configured to use PHP 8.0. When changing the PHP version, you'll need to update it in these workflow files:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/test-analyse.yml` and update the PHP version:

```yaml
- name: Setup php
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '8.0'
    tools: cs2pr
```

2. Also update the PHP version in `.github/workflows/install-deps.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Setup php
  uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
  with:
    php-version: '8.0'
```

3. Check for PHP version constraints in static analysis configurations:
   - `phpstan.neon.dist` might have PHP version specific settings
   - `phpcs.xml.dist` might have PHP version specific ruleset configurations

Keeping PHP versions consistent across all configurations ensures that your development, testing, and deployment environments all work with the same PHP constraints.

## Advanced Features

### ACF JSON Sync

The boilerplate supports Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) JSON synchronization. All ACF field group JSON files should be stored in `resources/acf-json/`.

To enable ACF JSON sync in your plugin:

1. Create the `resources/acf-json` directory
2. Add the following code to your `load_dependencies()` method in the main Demo_Plugin class:

#### Option 1: Direct approach with anonymous functions

```php
/**
 * Load the required dependencies for this plugin.
 *
 * @since    1.0.0
 * @access   private
 */
private function load_dependencies(): void {
    $this->loader = new Loader();
    
    // ACF JSON Support
    add_filter(
        'acf/settings/save_json',
        function () {
            if ( wp_get_environment_type() !== 'production' ) {
                return DEMO_PLUGIN_PATH . 'resources/acf-json';
            }
            return '';
        }
    );
    add_filter(
        'acf/settings/load_json',
        function ( $paths ) {
            $paths[] = DEMO_PLUGIN_PATH . 'resources/acf-json';
            return $paths;
        }
    );
}
```

#### Option 2: Separate class for managing multiple field groups

For more complex setups with multiple field groups, create a dedicated class:

```php
<?php
/**
 * ACF Configuration.
 *
 * @package Demo_Plugin
 */

namespace Demo_Plugin\Integrations\ACF;

/**
 * ACF Configuration class.
 */
class Config {

    /**
     * Register all needed hooks.
     */
    public function __construct() {
        // Whitelist specific field groups to save
        add_filter( 'acf/settings/save_json/key=group_example1', array( $this, 'save_path' ) );
        add_filter( 'acf/settings/save_json/key=group_example2', array( $this, 'save_path' ) );
        add_filter( 'acf/settings/save_json/key=group_example3', array( $this, 'save_path' ) );
        
        // Add load path
        add_filter( 'acf/settings/load_json', array( $this, 'load_path' ) );
    }

    /**
     * Register the save path
     *
     * @return string The save path.
     */
    public function save_path(): string {
        if ( wp_get_environment_type() !== 'production' ) {
            return DEMO_PLUGIN_PATH . 'resources/acf-json';
        }
        return '';
    }

    /**
     * Register the load path.
     *
     * @param array<string> $paths The current paths.
     * @return array<string> The manipulated paths.
     */
    public function load_path( array $paths ): array {
        // Optional: Remove default path
        // unset( $paths[0] );
        
        $paths[] = DEMO_PLUGIN_PATH . 'resources/acf-json';
        return $paths;
    }
}
```

Then initialize it in your main plugin class:

```php
private function load_dependencies(): void {
    $this->loader = new Loader();
    
    // Initialize ACF configuration
    new \Demo_Plugin\Integrations\ACF\Config();
}
```
