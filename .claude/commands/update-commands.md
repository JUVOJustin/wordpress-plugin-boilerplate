Update the claude commands from the remote repository

1. Get .claude/commands of the https://github.com/JUVOJustin/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate repository
2. Compare the existing commands with the new commands
3. Add new commands only present in the remote repository
4. Update commands present in both repositories. If the difference is too big, ask the user to confirm. Generally the remote repository is the source of truth.
5. Ask the user to confirm the removal of commands only present in the local repository
