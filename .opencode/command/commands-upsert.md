description: Add boilerplate commands to this workspace
---

1. Get .opencode/command of the https://github.com/JUVOJustin/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate repository. Try to access them via web or clone them to folder relative to the current workspace that you can access.
2. Compare the existing commands in `.opencode/command` with the new commands. 
3. Add new commands only present in the remote repository
4. Update commands present in both repositories. If the difference is too big, ask the user to confirm. Generally the remote repository is the source of truth.
5. Ask the user to confirm the removal of commands only present in the local repository
